Recently, however, I ran up so many travel expenses in a month that I hit my credit limit (the clearest sign yet that I’ve been on the road too much). So in order to keep further charges from being declined, I went to the Citi credit cards site to make a manual payment. I wanted to use the same bank account for this manual payment that I use for my automatic one. But I couldn’t see how to do that, even after looking around the site for a while. The ‘MAKE A PAYMENT’ button was prominent enough, but clicking on it didn’t take me to a page where I could see and select the bank account I use for autopay. Instead, it took me to a form I’d use to enter bank account information from scratch.','2014-11-10 00:00:00.000000','Why Is Customer Service Still So Lousy (Financial Services Web Design Edition)?',14),(3,'Yesterday we got the good news that The Second Machine Age had been shortlisted for the FT and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.

Most currencies exhibit a one-to-one transactional relationship. For example, the quantifiable value of a dollar is considered to be finite – it can only be used to buy one item or service at a time, or a person can only do one paid job at a time. But measuring the value of data is not constrained by those transactional limitations. In fact, data currency exhibits a network effect, where data can be used at the same time across multiple use cases thereby increasing its value to the organization. This makes data a powerful currency in which to invest. Nonetheless, we struggle to assign economic value to an intangible asset like data. Being able to attach economic value to data is key if we want organizations to truly manage data as a corporate asset. However, accounting already has a mechanism for quantifying the value of an intangible asset like data.

For those of you that don’t know what I’m talking about here, Mario Mazzola, Prem Jain, Luca Cafiero and Soni Jiandani were a legendary part of the Cisco story (and made for a handy self-referential acronym for those in the networking biz). Every high tech company has an innovation engine (usually more than one). At EMC, one innovation engine we use over and over again is EMC Ventures in addition to organic R&D.   Cisco used MPLS spin-out/spin-ins multiple times with great effect.    Many people noted the role of MPLS in Insieme (Nexus 9000 and ACI) and Project California (UCS, Nexus 1000v, Nexus 5000, Nexus 6000), but I think that misses important history.   People forget that back in the day, the networking business was much more fragmented – 3COM, Bay Networks, Cabletron and many, many others.    MPLS came to Cisco through the acquisition of Cresendo Networks – which ultimately resulted in the Catalyst family of switches, surely one of the most successful IT products ever, and the beginning of the dominance of Cisco, and the beginning of a long era.','2016-06-10 00:00:00.000000','The end of an era… Is always the start of a new one.',6),(14,'There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing.

If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off, attempting to escape an ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon, left behind after being struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the MAV ascended into space.

Today’s enterprises need to manage and govern the process of innovation; it is a crucial facet of a company’s overall function.','2016-05-03 00:00:00.000000','EA’s Role in the Innovation Management Process',1),(34,'hello','2021-02-22 19:49:03.690000','dd',16),(35,'yes','2021-02-22 19:49:28.132000','what?',16),(36,'## hello\r\n```java\r\nclass Hello{\r\n		System.out.println(\"hi\");\r\n}\r\n```','2021-02-23 00:42:45.457000','test',16),(37,'nginx in ubuntu20.04\r\n\r\n> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-nginx-server-and-location-block-selection-algorithms\r\n> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-20-04\r\n\r\n\r\n### 安装命令\r\n`$ sudo apt update`\r\n`$ sudo apt install nginx`\r\n\r\n### 查看防火墙\r\n`$ sudo ufw app list`\r\n`$ sudo ufw status`\r\n\r\n### 查看nginx\r\n`$ systemctl status nginx`\r\n`$ curl -4 icanhazip.com`\r\n`$ curl http://your_server_ip`\r\n\r\n### 管理nginx\r\n`sudo systemctl stop nginx`\r\n`sudo systemctl start nginx`\r\n`sudo systemctl restart nginx`\r\n`sudo systemctl reload nginx`\r\n`sudo systemctl disable nginx`\r\n`sudo systemctl enable nginx`\r\n\r\n### 设置服务块\r\nubuntu20.04上的Nginx有一个默认启用的服务器块，它被配置为在/var/www/html目录下提供文档。虽然这对单个站点很有效，但如果您托管多个站点，它可能会变得很不方便。与其修改/var/www/html，不如在/var/www中为您的域站点创建一个目录结构，如果客户端请求与任何其他站点不匹配，则保留/var/www/html作为默认目录。\r\n\r\n`$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/your_domain/html`\r\n`$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/your_domain/html`\r\n`$ sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/your_domain`\r\n`$ echo \"OK!\" > /var/www/your_domain/html/index.html`\r\n\r\n为了让Nginx提供这些内容，有必要使用正确的指令创建一个服务器块。与其直接修改默认配置文件，不如在/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain中创建一个新的配置文件：\r\n```nginx\r\nserver {\r\n        listen 80;\r\n        listen [::]:80;\r\n\r\n        root /var/www/your_domain/html;\r\n        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;\r\n\r\n        server_name your_domain www.your_domain;\r\n\r\n        location / {\r\n                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n接下来，让我们通过创建一个链接来启用该文件，该链接指向启用了站点的目录，Nginx在启动时从中读取该目录：\r\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\r\n\r\n为了避免由于添加两个server_name而可能出现的哈希桶内存问题，有必要调整/etc/nginx/nginx.conf文件中的配置：\r\n```nginx\r\n...\r\nhttp {\r\n    ...\r\n    server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n`$ sudo nginx -t`\r\n`$ sudo systemctl restart nginx`\r\n\r\n\r\n既然您已经知道如何管理Nginx服务本身，那么您应该花几分钟时间熟悉一些重要的目录和文件。\r\n\r\n\r\n/var/www/html: 实际的web内容，默认情况下仅由您之前看到的默认Nginx页面组成，由/var/www/html目录提供。这可以通过改变Nginx配置文件来改变。\r\n/etc/nginx: nginx配置目录。所有Nginx配置文件都驻留在这里。\r\n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf: Nginx主配置文件。可以对其进行修改以更改Nginx全局配置。\r\n/etc/nginx/sites-available: 可以存储每个站点服务器块的目录。Nginx不会使用此目录中的配置文件，除非它们链接到启用站点的目录。通常，所有服务器块配置都在这个目录中完成，然后通过链接到另一个目录来启用。\r\n/etc/nginx/sites-enabled: 存储每个站点启用的服务器块的目录。通常，这些是通过链接到站点可用目录中的配置文件来创建的。\r\n/etc/nginx/snippets: 这个目录包含可以包含在nginx配置中其他地方的配置片段。潜在的可重复配置段很适合重构为代码段。\r\n/var/log/nginx/access.log: 对web服务器的每个请求都记录在此日志文件中，除非Nginx配置为执行其他操作。\r\n/var/log/nginx/error.log: 任何Nginx错误都将记录在此日志中。\r\n\r\n## 首先，Nginx查看请求的IP地址和端口。它将此与每个服务器的listen指令相匹配，以构建可能解析请求的服务器块列表。\r\n\r\nlisten指令通常定义服务器块将响应的IP地址和端口。默认情况下，任何不包含listen指令的服务器块都被赋予listen参数0.0.0.0:80（如果Nginx是由正常的非root用户运行的，则为0.0.0.0:8080）。这允许这些块响应端口80上任何接口上的请求，但此默认值在服务器选择过程中没有太大的作用。\r\nlisten指令可以设置为：\r\n\r\n- IP地址/端口组合。\r\n- 一个单独的IP地址，然后在默认端口80上侦听。\r\n- 一个单独的端口，它将侦听该端口上的每个接口。\r\n- Unix套接字的路径。\r\n\r\n**最后一个选项通常只在不同服务器之间传递请求时才有意义。**\r\n\r\n当尝试确定向哪个服务器块发送请求时，Nginx将首先尝试使用以下规则根据listen指令的特定性来决定：\r\n\r\n1. Nginx通过用缺省值替换丢失的值来翻译所有“不完整”的listen指令，这样每个块都可以通过其IP地址和端口进行计算。下面是一些实例：\r\n- 没有listen指令的块使用默认值0.0.0.0:80。\r\n- 设置为IP地址111.111.111.111（没有端口）的块变为111.111.111.111:80\r\n- 设置为没有IP地址的端口8888的块变为0.0.0.0:8888\r\n\r\n2. 然后Nginx尝试收集一个服务器块列表，这些服务器块与基于IP地址和端口的请求最为匹配。这意味着，如果存在列出特定IP地址的匹配块，则在功能上使用0.0.0.0作为其IP地址（以匹配任何接口）的任何块都不会被选中。无论如何，端口必须完全匹配。\r\n\r\n3. 如果只有一个最特定的匹配项，则该服务器块将用于服务请求。如果有多个服务器块具有相同级别的特定性匹配，Nginx将开始计算每个服务器块的server_name指令。\r\n\r\n重要的是要理解，Nginx只会在需要区分与listen指令中的同一特定级别匹配的服务器块时才计算server_name指令。例如，如果example.com网站托管在192.168.1.10的端口80上，请求example.com网站将始终由本例中的第一个块提供服务，尽管第二个块中有server_name指令。\r\n\r\n```nginx\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 192.168.1.10;\r\n}\r\n\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 80;\r\n    server_name example.com;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 接下来，为了进一步评估具有同样特定的listen指令的请求，Nginx检查请求的“Host”头。此值保存客户端实际尝试访问的域或IP地址。\r\n\r\n- Nginx将首先尝试找到一个服务器块，其服务器名称与请求的“Host”头中的值完全匹配。如果找到这个，关联的块将用于服务请求。如果找到多个完全匹配，则使用第一个。\r\n- 如果找不到完全匹配的服务器，Nginx将尝试使用前导通配符（在配置中名称的开头用\\*表示）查找具有匹配的server_name的服务器块。如果找到一个，则该块将用于服务请求。如果找到多个匹配项，则最长的匹配项将用于服务请求。\r\n- 如果使用前导通配符找不到匹配项，Nginx将查找具有server_name且使用尾随通配符匹配的服务器块（由配置中以\\*结尾的服务器名称表示）。如果找到一个，则该块用于服务请求。如果找到多个匹配项，则最长的匹配项将用于服务请求。\r\n- 如果使用尾随通配符找不到匹配项，Nginx将使用正则表达式（在名称前用\\~表示）计算定义server_name的服务器块。第一个server_name（带有与“Host”头匹配的正则表达式）将用于服务请求。\r\n\r\n### 实例：\r\n修改/etc/hosts\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n192.168.0.198 example.com\r\n192.168.0.198 www.example.com\r\n192.168.0.198 abc.example.com\r\n192.168.0.198 www.example.cn\r\n192.168.0.198 www.example.org\r\n192.168.0.198 www.abc.org\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n192.168.0.198 nginx.conf\r\n```nginx\r\n# example.com:8080 找不到匹配的server_name 使用第一个匹配端口的server块\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 8080;\r\n    server_name localhost;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"localhost\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# www.example.com:8080 完全匹配\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 8080;\r\n    server_name www.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"www.example.com\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# abc.example.com:8080\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 8080;\r\n    server_name *.example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"*.example.com\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# www.example.cn:8080\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 8080;\r\n    server_name www.example.*;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"www.example.*\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# www.abc.org:8080\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 8080;\r\n    server_name *.org;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"*.org\"; \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# www.example.org:8080\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 8080;\r\n    server_name *.example.org;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"*.example.org\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 9800;\r\n    server_name example.com;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"first\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# www.example.com:9800 使用第一个匹配的正则表达式响应请求\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 9800;\r\n    server_name ~^(www|host1).*\\.example\\.com$;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"second\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nserver {\r\n    listen 9800;\r\n    server_name ~^(subdomain|set|www|host1).*\\.example\\.com$;\r\n    location / {\r\n        echo \"third\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n','2021-02-23 00:45:40.984000','nginx',16);
